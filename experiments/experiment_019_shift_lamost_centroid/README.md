Experiment to investigate how changing LAMOST's FP centroids (rmean, smean, imean), while keeping a, b, and c (from the combined FP) constant will affect the log-distance ratio, and ultimately the PV bias against redshift.

Method: keep a, b, c from the combined fit, but change either the rmean, smean, or imean.

Since c = rmean - a * smean - b * imean

We can only change two variables.
