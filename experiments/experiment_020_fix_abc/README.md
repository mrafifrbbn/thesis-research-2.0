Similar to experiment 019, but here we are refitting the FP for the three surveys by fixing a, b, and c to the combined sample.
That is, we are varying rmean, smean, imean, and the sigmas.

Nevertheless, since c is dependent on the centroid, one is a dependent variable while the other two are independent variables.

Results:
- The results/best fit FP is independent of the choice of the dependent variable.
- The north-south bias is worse than using the combined fit.
- The individual comparison
