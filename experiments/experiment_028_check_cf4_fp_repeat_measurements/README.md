Experiment to investigate the cause of the few outliers in the 6dFGS-CF4 distance moduli comparison.

Progress:
- Galaxies whose distances were measured from multiple FPs actually agree very well with my 6dFGS distances.
- Most of the extreme outliers are because of repeat measurements with other methods: SNIa, TF, and SBF mainly
- Created folders corresponding to each survey to store PGC of galaxies with multiple measurements
